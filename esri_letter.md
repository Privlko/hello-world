As a recent PhD graduate in Quantitative Sociology from Maynooth University I am a good fit for ESRI's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. My experience in conducting survey research, pursuing publication, and evaluating public policy would be beneficial to the position. 

I believe I have the neccessary experience for the role. Since finishing my PhD, I have been working as a researcher with Dublin City Council, evaluating housing policy goals using internal data, and the CSO's Census (2011, 2016) figures. During my five years at Maynooth University, I served as a Research Assistant and Administrator to an ERC-Funded research project (NEWDEALS).  In this position I analysed and cleaned data from the European Working Conditions Survey, the European Social Survey, and the European Labour Force Survey. These positions introduced me to a range of data formats, and gave me a wide range of quantitative skills in three statistical languages; SPSS, Stata, and R. As an example, I was instrumental in creating a macro-variable dataset for NEWDEALS, which contained a range of indicators- from Chinese imports to share of household debt. This involved the design, merging, and cleaning of macro-variables for 18 European countries.   

I believe I have the necessary skills for the role. I completed a PhD in Quantitative Sociology which used two longitudinal datasets (the British Household Panel Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel) to estimate worker returns on job mobility. In this position too, I crafted a research project specific to the field, designed data frames from individual surveys and job history files, analysed the results, and communicated the project effectively. In order to complete the project  


Similar to Prof Frances McGinnity and Prof Hellen Russell, I am interested in the impact of precarious and unstable work, from a comparative perspective. As of March, I am pursuing peer-reviewed publications from the PhD; one paper is under review with the International Journal of Manpower, and one is a working paper.

Regarding methodology, I have a keen interest in longitudinal methods including fixed-effects and random-effects linear models. Regarding theory, I'm interested in two subfields. First, the impact of labour market transitions on worker outcomes; how does movement between jobs and occupations affect worker outcomes like pay? Second, how do changes in social roles like parenthood and marriage affect outcomes like pay, and how are they gendered?
