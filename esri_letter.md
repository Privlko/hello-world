I would like to formally apply for ESRI's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. As a recent PhD graduate in Quantitative Sociology, I believe I have skills and experience for the role. 

Since finishing my PhD, I have been working as a researcher with Dublin City Council, evaluating housing policy goals using internal survey data, and the CSO's Census data (2011, 2016). During my five years at Maynooth University, I served as a Research Assistant and Administrator to an ERC-Funded research project (NEWDEALS).  In this position I analysed and cleaned data from the European Working Conditions Survey, the European Social Survey, and the European Labour Force Survey. As an example, I was instrumental in creating a macro-variable dataset for NEWDEALS, which contained a range of indicators- from Chinese imports to share of household debt. This involved the design, merging, and cleaning of macro-variables for 18 European countries.   

During this time I developed several skills that would complement the Fellowship. I completed a PhD in Quantitative Sociology which used two longitudinal datasets (the British Household Panel Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel) to estimate worker returns on job mobility. I became a profficient user of SPSS, Stata, and R. I also learned several data analysis techniques for cross sectional and longitudinal data, including statistical inference, crss-sectional linear models, cross sectional logit and probit models, longitudinal linear models, and event history analysis. Throughout my PhD, I crafted a research project specific to the field, designed data frames from individual surveys and job history files, analysed the results, and communicated the project effectively.  I am currently seeking to publich work from the thesis. One paper is under review with the International Journal of Manpower, and one is a working paper.

Similar to Prof Frances McGinnity and Prof Hellen Russell, I am interested in the impact of precarious and unstable work from a comparative perspective. Within the sociology of work and employment, I'm interested in two subfields. First, the impact of labour market transitions on worker outcomes; how does movement between jobs and occupations affect worker outcomes like pay? Second, how do changes in social roles like parenthood and marriage affect outcomes like pay, and how are they gendered?
